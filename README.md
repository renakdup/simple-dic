Simple DI Container with **autowiring** in a single file **with NO dependencies** allows you to easily use it in your PHP applications and especially convenient for **WordPress** plugins and themes. 

## Why choose Simple DI Container
1. Easy to integrate in your WordPress project - just copy one file or install via Composer.
2. No dependencies on other scripts or libraries.
3. Supports auto-wiring `__constructor` parameters for classes as well as for scalar types that have default values.
4. Supports PHP ^7.4|^8.
5. Allow you following the best practices for developing your code.
6. No PHPCS conflicts.
7. Supports Lazy Load class instantiating.
8. Lightweight and fast.

## How to install in a project
There are several ways, you can choose what you more prefer:

### Install via Composer
```bash
composer require renakdup/simple-php-dic
```

### Copy and paste file
   1. Just copy the file `./src/Container.php` to your plugin directory or theme.
   2. Rename `namespace` in the file  
   from `Renakdup\SimpleDIC` to `<Your_Plugin_Name>\SimpleDIC`
   3. Include the file.

## How to use it

### Get started:
1. Create container instance.
2. Set a service
3. Get a service
4. Use object
```php
use Renakdup\SimpleDIC\Container;

// create container
$container = new Container();

// set service
$container->set( Paypal::class, function () {
    return new Paypal();
} );

// get service
$paypal = $container->get( Paypal::class );

// use this object
$paypal->pay();
```

SimpleDIC allows to set values for the container for primitive types:
```php
$container->set( 'requests_limit', 100 );
$container->set( 'post_type', 'products' );
$container->set( 'users_ids', [ 1, 2, 3, 4] );

$user_ids = $container->get( 'users_ids', [ 1, 2, 3, 4] );
```

Method `get()` can resolve not set object in the `$container` and then save resolved results in the `$container`. It means when you run `$container->get( $service )` several times you get the same object.

```php
$obj1 = $constructor->get( Paypal::class );
$obj2 = $constructor->get( Paypal::class );
var_dump( $obj1 === $obj2 ) // true
```

If you want to instantiate service several time use `make()` method. 

---

### Factory
Factory is an `anonymous function` that wrap creating an instance.  
Allows to configure how an object will be created and allows to use `Conainer` instance inside the factory.

```php
$container->set( Paypal::class, function () {
    return new Paypal();
} );
```

As well factories create objects in the Lazy Load mode. It means that object will be created just when you resolve it by using `get()` method:

```php
$container->set( Paypal::class, function () {
    return new Paypal();
} );

$paypal = $constructor->get( Paypal::class ); // PayPal instance created
```

---

### Container inside factory
**SimpleDIC** allows to get a `Container` instance inside a factory if you add parameter in a callback `( Container $c )`. This allows to get or resolve another services inside for building an object:
```php
$container->set( 'config', [
    'currency' => '$',
    'environment' => 'production',
] );

$container->set( Paypal::class, function ( Container $c ) {
    return new Paypal( $c->get('config') );
} );
```

---

### Autowiring
**SimpleDIÐ¡** autowiring feature **allows to `Container` automatically create and inject dependencies**.

I'll show an example:
```php
class PayPalSDK {}
class Logger {}

class Paypal {
    public function __constructor( PayPalSDK $pal_sdk, Logger $logger ) {
        //...
    }
}
```
And then when you create `Paypal::class`, you run `$container->get(Paypal::class)`, and `Container` identifies all classes in the constructor and resolves them. As if it's:
```php
new Paypal( new PayPalSDK(), new Logger() );
```
---
Container autowiring can resolve default values for *primitive* parameters in a constructor:
```php
class Logger {
    public function __constructor( $type = 'filestorage', $error_lvl = 1 ) {
        //...
    }
}
```

You can use **auto-wiring** feature that allows to `Container` create an instances that requires in the `__constructor` of class as well as it resolves constructor dependencies for 


> [!NOTE]
> But if object creating is more complex and requires configuring and you don't have parameters with default values in the constructor then you need to use `factory` for preparing service.

---


### Create an instance every time

Method `make()` resolves services by its name. It returns a new instance of service every time and supports auto-wiring.

```php
$conatainer->make( Paypal::class );
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Constructor's dependencies will not instantiate every time.  
> If dependencies were resolved before then they will be passed as resolved dependencies.

Consider example:
```php
class PayPalSDK {}

class Paypal {
    public PayPalSDK $pal_sdk;
    public function __constructor( PayPalSDK $pal_sdk ) {
        $this->pal_sdk = $pal_sdk;
    }
}

// if we create PayPal instances twice
$paypal1 = $container->make( Paypal::class );
$paypal2 = $container->make( Paypal::class );

var_dump( $paypal1 !== $paypal2 ); // true
var_dump( $paypal1->pal_sdk === $paypal2->pal_sdk ); // true
```
Dependencies of PayPal service will not be recreated and will be taken from already resolved objects.

## PSR11 Compatibility
in progress

## Roadmap
- [x] Add binding services with configuration
- [x] Add auto-wiring for registered classes in DIC
- [x] Add auto-wiring for defaults primitives for auto-fillings
- [x] Add supporting invocable classes
- [x] Add PSR11 interfaces in the Container.php.
- [x] Add auto-wiring support for not bounded classes.
- [x] Add resolved service storage (getting singleton).
- [x] Add ability to create new instances of service every time.
- [x] Improve performance.
- [x] Fix deprecated `Use ReflectionParameter::getType() and the ReflectionType APIs should be used instead.` for PHP8
- [x] Bind $container instance by default.
- [ ] Add `remove` method.
- [ ] Circular dependency protector.

## Nice to have
- [x] Integrate CI with running autotests
- [x] Add badges with tests passed
- [x] Add PHPStan analyzer
- [ ] Add code coverage badge
- [ ] Add descriptions in the code for functions.
- [ ] Choose codestyle
- [ ] Add on packegist
- [ ] Add if class exist checks in the Container file?
